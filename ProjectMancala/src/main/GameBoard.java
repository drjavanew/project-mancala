/*TODO:
 * 
 * In this class, we should build the gameboard and all of it's properties. So things we should include in here are:
 * 
 * Each player's pots, with player ownership (although we can do this in the LinkList/Array classes.
 * We should also have win conditions, pot placement in the window, and pool placement.
 * Possibly we should have the score and what not placed in here too referenced from the LinkList/Array classes.
