 * TODO:
 * 
 * In this class, we need to have the LinkList side of the logic. That is if we're using the Link List.
 * We should have the pot/pool content and logic in this area. Unless we decide to use the Array Method.
 * For now I'm going to assume we're using the Link List method, which I'll be using reference material from here:
 * http://www.java-tips.org/java-se-tips/java.lang/linked-list-implementation-in-java.html
 * 
 * Hopefully that'll help both of us better to understand Link Lists in Java.
