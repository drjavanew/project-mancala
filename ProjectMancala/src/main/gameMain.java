 * This is the gameMain, where we'll do our game loop and all of our execution using the other classes.
 * 
 * We've currently got these classes:
 * 
 * ArrayMethod: For utilizing Arrays for game logic.
 * LinkList: For utilizing Link lists for game logic.
 * GameBoard: Where we'll be doing things involving the game board (possibly drawing it).
 * 
 * I'm thinking I'll create a Window/JavaApp class to possibly build the window where we'll be hosting our game.
